The Ultimate Snake Game in Python

A classic game of Snake. I used Turtle library to create it. I also used classes and functions in the project.
I created 4 .py files:
- snake.py - which is a model of Snake
- food.py - which is a model of food, that Snake eats
- scoreboard.py - which is a model of Score, that is changing when the Snake eats the food. It also has a function of High Score.
- main.py - imports the Snake, Food, Scoreboard models. It also contains the Screen and launches the game.

There is also a data.txt file, which contains the High Score of the game.

I hope you will enjoy the game :)
